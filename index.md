# Strategic DDD

## Introduction

I have based this article in the Vaughn Vernon book titled "Implementing Domain Driven Design". At the time of writing this
article I have to recognize that I am not an expert in DDD so it is probably that this content doesn't answer all your 
questions about Strategic DDD. It is a complex subject and I have needed to read several times some of the chapters in the book 
to understand the large amount of concepts that are explained there. Many of the concepts are quite abstract and although the 
book contains some examples it has been difficult for me to think how these concepts could fit in the projects I am currenly 
working on.
Nevertheless I am going to do my best in explaining the main concepts in a simple way and provide some more examples that 
those provided by the book so you can achieve a better understanding.
Before reading the Vernon's book I had read lots of articles in internet about DDD, forum discussions, youtube videos, and 
more. Until I read the book I didn't quite understand exactly what DDD was, the information I found sometimes was confusing 
and other times contradictory. I understood it as a one more architecture, a kind of extended hexagonal architecture, but 
as we are going to see next it is much more than that.

## Strategic DDD

In this article I am going to explain only one part of DDD, what is called strategic DDD. This part is explained in the 
three first chapters of Vernon's book. This part of DDD neither talk about code, nor about message brokers, nor about 
databases, nor about events... It talks exclusively about business.
This part explains how to carry out a strategy for building software systems that are closer to business ideas. Many times 
developers are or have been very far from the business experts, or these experts try to convey an idea to the developer 
teams but then the software that it is built is quite different than the original idea and it can even lose the essence 
of that idea. Moreover many developer teams tend to build software systems that are difficult to change and in a world 
that evolves very fast and it is continuosly changing these systems doesn't have the necessary flexibility to allow 
fast changes and adaptation. The DDD approach is based in bring near the developers and the business experts so they 
work together. This way the communication flows in a natural way and it is more likely that the software that it is 
being built ends up being very much better aligned with the original idea, the idea that would have been built the 
business experts if they were developers.
